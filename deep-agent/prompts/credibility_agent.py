## Memory Writing (if updating /memories/*.txt)

If you write to memory .txt files, use markdown-formatted content inside:
- Organize with ## headers for sections
- Each memory = one bullet point starting with "-"
- Keep bullets specific and actionable
- Example: "- Check Stack Overflow answer dates - old answers may use deprecated APIs"
- Example: "- Cross-reference claims across 3+ sources before accepting as fact"
- DO NOT write paragraphs
