    "# Credibility Sub-Agent Test Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tests the credibility sub-agent, which is responsible for:\n",
    "- **Claim Verification**: Checking if claims are supported by reliable evidence\n",
    "- **Source Assessment**: Evaluating the trustworthiness of sources used\n",
    "- **Consistency Checking**: Looking for contradictions or inconsistencies\n",
    "- **Bias Identification**: Noting potential biases in sources or analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The main agent uses this sub-agent to:\n",
    "- Verify research findings from the web research agent\n",
    "- Assess source quality and reliability\n",
    "- Identify potential misinformation or biased reporting\n",
    "- Rate overall trustworthiness of gathered information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook connects to the LangGraph server, which provides:\n",
    "- **Cloud-hosted store** - Persistent memory across sessions (same as LangSmith Studio)\n",
    "- **Cloud-hosted checkpointer** - Conversation state persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start the LangGraph server** (from the `deep-agent/` directory):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd deep-agent\n",
    "   langgraph dev\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wait for the server** to be ready at `http://localhost:2024`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run this notebook** - it connects to the same agent as LangSmith Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `langgraph dev`, LangGraph connects to LangSmith's cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Agent state persists across sessions\n",
    "- No local PostgreSQL database required\n",
    "- Assistant ID is auto-discovered so this notebook works for anyone\n"

       "  - Status: **CONTRADICTED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Recent market-cap rankings (e.g., Investopedia’s “Biggest Companies in the World by Market Cap” and Yahoo Finance’s coverage of “Trillion‑dollar companies”) show **Nvidia** and **Microsoft** competing for and holding the top spot around 2025, with market values above Apple’s. One Yahoo Finance article notes Nvidia as the *first* company to reach a $4 trillion market value in July 2025, clearly exceeding Apple’s market cap.

       "## ✅ Response\n",
       "### Claim Verification\n",
       "- **Claim 1: “NVIDIA's data center revenue grew over 200% year-over-year in their most recent quarter”** – **LIKELY VERIFIED (but wording is sloppy)**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Recent quarters (e.g., FY2024 Q3/Q4 and into 2024) show data center revenue up well over 200% YoY (some quarters 300–400%+ YoY). However, “most recent quarter” is time‑sensitive; if a later quarter had lower growth, this could become outdated. Directionally correct, but should cite an exact quarter and percentage from NVIDIA IR.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Claim 2: “The company has captured approximately 80-90% of the AI chip market”** – **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Multiple analyses and commentary (e.g., Forbes, other financial media) state NVIDIA holds ~80–90% of the *AI accelerator / AI compute GPU* market for data centers, not the entire “AI chip market” (which also includes CPUs, ASICs like TPUs, edge chips, etc.). The claim is broadly accepted but imprecisely framed and usually based on analyst estimates, not hard official data.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Claim 3: “Major tech companies including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are all using NVIDIA GPUs for AI workloads”** – **VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Widely reported by major outlets and in company/NVIDIA materials that Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS all offer NVIDIA GPU instances (H100, A100, etc.) and use them for AI training/inference services.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Claim 4: “The stock has risen over 200% in 2024”** – **LIKELY CONTRADICTED / TIME-DEPENDENT**\n",
       "  - Evidence: NVIDIA had massive gains in 2023–2024, but “over 200% in 2024” alone is suspect; the >200% move is more often quoted for 2023 or for a 12‑month / multi‑year window. This needs a specific start/end date and price check; as written it is almost certainly inaccurate for the calendar year 2024 alone.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Source Assessment\n",
       "- **Overall source quality: 4/5**\n",
       "  - NVIDIA IR, Reuters, Bloomberg are high‑credibility. TechCrunch is decent for tech news but less authoritative for financial magnitudes.\n",
       "- **Concerns:**\n",
       "  - No direct citations or links to specific filings/articles.\n",
       "  - Market-share and performance numbers appear to rely on secondary commentary, not clearly tied to primary data.\n",
       "  - Some claims are time‑sensitive but lack dates.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Answer Quality\n",
       "- **Does it answer the original question (“Why has NVIDIA stock performed so well recently?”)?** – **Partially**\n",
       "- **Missing elements:**\n",
       "  - Explanation of *mechanism*: e.g., AI boom, hyperscaler capex, scarcity of competitive alternatives, margins, earnings beats, guidance, and valuation re‑rating.\n",
       "  - Time framing: “recently” is vague; performance vs which period?\n",
       "  - No discussion of risks, sustainability, or broader market context (rates, tech rally).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recommendations\n",
       "- Specify quarters and exact YoY growth numbers from NVIDIA IR for data center revenue.\n",
       "- Clarify Claim 2 to “~80–90% of the data center AI accelerator/GPU market, per analyst estimates.”\n",
       "- Correct or precisely time‑bound the stock‑performance claim (e.g., “up ~X% from Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2024,” with price data).\n",
       "- Expand the narrative to explicitly connect:\n",
       "  - Explosive data center revenue growth\n",
       "  - Dominant AI GPU share\n",
       "  - Broad adoption by hyperscalers\n",
       "  - Resulting earnings and cash-flow growth  \n",
       "  to the stock’s outperformance.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Final Verdict\n",
       "- **Trustworthy and defensible?** – **With caveats**\n",
       "  - Directionally credible and based on solid types of sources, but some numerical claims are imprecise or likely inaccurate without tighter dates and citations, and the explanation of “why” is incomplete."

       "### Claim Verification\n",
       "- “Tesla will dominate the robotaxi market by 2025”: **UNVERIFIED (highly speculative)**\n",
       "  - Evidence: No commercial, large-scale Tesla robotaxi service is operating as of late 2024; regulatory approvals are limited and timelines repeatedly slip. “Dominate” and 2025 are forward-looking opinion, not fact.\n",
       "- “Full Self-Driving is already safer than human drivers”: **UNVERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Tesla cites internal miles-per-accident data, but independent regulators (e.g., NHTSA) have not certified FSD as safer than human drivers. Methodology, exposure, and selection bias are contested.\n",
       "- “Tesla's margins are industry-leading and sustainable”: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Historically true that Tesla had higher auto gross margins than many legacy OEMs, but 2023–24 reports show margin compression from price cuts and competition; “sustainable” is speculative.\n",
       "- “Competition from legacy automakers is irrelevant”: **CONTRADICTED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: VW, Ford, Hyundai/Kia, etc., are meaningfully present in EV markets; Tesla’s share has declined in some regions. Competition is clearly not “irrelevant.”\n",
       "\n",
       "- “Tesla's FSD claims are exaggerated and potentially dangerous”: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Multiple regulator investigations, crashes under review, and litigation suggest non-trivial safety concerns and debates over marketing claims. “Exaggerated/potentially dangerous” is evaluative but grounded in real investigations.\n",
       "- “Margins are declining due to price cuts and competition”: **VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Confirmed in recent Tesla earnings and major financial press: repeated price cuts and competition have pressured margins.\n",
       "- “Chinese EV makers are taking significant market share”: **VERIFIED (especially outside US)**\n",
       "  - Evidence: BYD and others have gained major share in China and are expanding abroad; they are intensifying competition, even if US penetration is limited by tariffs.\n",
       "- “Robotaxi timeline has been repeatedly delayed”: **VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Elon Musk has publicly shifted robotaxi/FSD timelines multiple times over years without full delivery of prior promises.\n",
       "\n",
       "- “Tesla maintains technology leadership but faces margin pressure”: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Widely accepted that Tesla is a tech leader in EV powertrain/software, while filings and earnings calls show margin compression.\n",
       "- “FSD progress is notable but regulatory approval timeline uncertain”: **VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Software advances and wider beta use are real, but no clear, binding timeline from regulators for full robotaxi deployment.\n",
       "- “Competition is intensifying but Tesla's brand remains strong”: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Increasing EV offerings globally; Tesla still has strong brand recognition and loyalty, though reputation is more polarizing than in earlier years.\n",

       "### Source Assessment\n",
       "- Overall source quality:\n",
       "  - TeslaDaily fan blog: **2/5**\n",
       "  - Hindenburg short-seller report: **3/5**\n",
       "  - Goldman Sachs equity research: **4/5**\n",
       "- Concerns:\n",
       "  - TeslaDaily: Strong bullish bias, promotional tone, heavy speculation on timelines and dominance.\n",
       "  - Hindenburg: Financial incentive to highlight worst-case scenarios; may overemphasize negatives and tail risks.\n",
       "  - Goldman Sachs: Bank research has conflicts (investment banking, trading interests) but uses structured models, disclosures, and is generally more balanced.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Answer Quality\n",
       "- Does it answer the original question (“12‑month outlook for Tesla stock”)? **Partially**\n",
       "- Missing elements:\n",
       "  - No explicit 12‑month risk/reward, scenario analysis, or valuation (P/E, FCF, relative to peers).\n",
       "  - No macro context (rates, EV subsidies, China policy, US tariffs).\n",
       "  - No distinction between long-term optionality (robotaxis) vs what will realistically move the stock in 12 months (deliveries, pricing, margins, regulation).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recommendations\n",
       "- Suggested corrections or additions:\n",
       "  - Treat robotaxi “dominance by 2025” and FSD safety superiority as speculative and unproven; clearly label them as opinion.\n",
       "  - Emphasize verified facts: margin compression, growing competition (especially China), continued tech and brand strengths.\n",
       "  - Use neutral primary data: Tesla financials, regulator actions, and multiple analyst reports, not just fan/short pieces.\n",
       "- Areas needing more research:\n",
       "  - Latest quarterly results (margins, volumes, capex, FSD revenue).\n",
       "  - Regulatory trajectory for autonomous driving in key markets.\n",
       "  - Comparative valuation vs other large-cap growth/auto/tech names.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Final Verdict\n",
       "- Trustworthy and defensible? **With caveats**\n",
       "  - On their own, the fan blog and short-seller report are too biased to rely on.  \n",
       "  - Goldman Sachs-style neutral research plus primary data provides the most credible base; the others are useful mainly to understand upside/downside narratives, not as factual guides."
