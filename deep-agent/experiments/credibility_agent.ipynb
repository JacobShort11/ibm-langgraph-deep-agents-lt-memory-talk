    "# Credibility Sub-Agent Test Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tests the credibility sub-agent, which is responsible for:\n",
    "- **Claim Verification**: Checking if claims are supported by reliable evidence\n",
    "- **Source Assessment**: Evaluating the trustworthiness of sources used\n",
    "- **Consistency Checking**: Looking for contradictions or inconsistencies\n",
    "- **Bias Identification**: Noting potential biases in sources or analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The main agent uses this sub-agent to:\n",
    "- Verify research findings from the web research agent\n",
    "- Assess source quality and reliability\n",
    "- Identify potential misinformation or biased reporting\n",
    "- Rate overall trustworthiness of gathered information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook connects to the LangGraph server, which provides:\n",
    "- **Cloud-hosted store** - Persistent memory across sessions (same as LangSmith Studio)\n",
    "- **Cloud-hosted checkpointer** - Conversation state persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start the LangGraph server** (from the `deep-agent/` directory):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd deep-agent\n",
    "   langgraph dev\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wait for the server** to be ready at `http://localhost:2024`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run this notebook** - it connects to the same agent as LangSmith Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `langgraph dev`, LangGraph connects to LangSmith's cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Agent state persists across sessions\n",
    "- No local PostgreSQL database required\n",
    "- Assistant ID is auto-discovered so this notebook works for anyone\n"

       "### Claim Verification\n",
       "- [Claim]: “Apple Inc. is the most valuable publicly traded company in the world by market capitalization.”\n",
       "  - Status: CONTRADICTED\n",
       "  - Evidence:  \n",
       "    - Recent rankings and commentary (e.g., Forbes India explainers and finance coverage in 2025) indicate that **Nvidia’s market cap is higher than Apple’s**, often cited around $4.5–5T for Nvidia vs. about $4T for Apple, with Microsoft also in the multi‑trillion range.  \n",
       "    - An Investopedia explainer on “Biggest Companies in the World by Market Cap” (regularly updated) lists **Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft all above $3T**, and explicitly frames them as the top three—Apple is *among* the biggest, not clearly the largest.  \n",
       "    - Additional 2025 coverage (e.g., Forbes India: “Top 10 largest companies in the world by market valuation in 2025”) explicitly states that **Nvidia leads the list**, with Apple in a lower rank (reported as third) by market cap.  \n",
       "  - Conclusion: As of late 2025, the consensus from financial data and rankings is that **Apple is one of the largest by market cap, but not the single largest**; Nvidia (and sometimes Microsoft depending on the day) is ahead. The claim that Apple *is the most valuable* is therefore inaccurate on the current date.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Source Assessment\n",
       "- Overall source quality: 4/5  \n",
       "- Concerns:\n",
       "  - Some content surfaced was generic or SEO‑oriented; needed cross‑reading to ensure it reflected **current** 2025 data.\n",
       "  - Rankings move frequently; any static article can be stale if not checked for update dates and cross‑referenced with live market‑cap data.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Answer Quality\n",
       "- Does it answer the original question? Yes  \n",
       "- Missing elements:\n",
       "  - Exact live market‑cap figures and tick‑by‑tick ranking as of this minute (would require direct live feed from a market data provider).\n",
       "  - A precise statement of *which* company is #1 right now (likely Nvidia, but rankings can change daily).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recommendations\n",
       "- Suggested corrections or additions:\n",
       "  - Replace the claim with: “Apple is one of the most valuable publicly traded companies in the world by market capitalization (typically in the top three), but it is **not consistently the single largest** as of late 2025; Nvidia generally holds the top spot.”\n",
       "- Areas needing more research:\n",
       "  - Pull real‑time market‑cap data from a live financial terminal or API (e.g., Bloomberg, Refinitiv, or full Yahoo Finance screener) for the exact up‑to‑the‑minute ranking.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Final Verdict\n",
       "- Trustworthy and defensible? **Needs work**  \n",
       "  The claim, as an absolute statement about Apple being the most valuable company “now,” is **not supported** by up‑to‑date 2025 evidence."

       "## ✅ Response\n",
       "### Claim Verification\n",
       "- **Claim 1: “NVIDIA's data center revenue grew over 200% year-over-year in their most recent quarter”** – **CONTRADICTED (for the most recent quarter)**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Recent coverage (e.g., Investopedia summary of Nvidia’s latest results) cites data center revenue up ~93% YoY in the latest reported quarter, not >200%. Nvidia did have >200% YoY data center growth in earlier FY 2024 quarters, but that is no longer true “in their most recent quarter.” The statement is outdated and misworded.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Claim 2: “The company has captured approximately 80-90% of the AI chip market”** – **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Multiple analyses (e.g., Yahoo Finance / GuruFocus-style reports) cite Nvidia with ~90% share of AI/data-center GPUs. However, “AI chip market” is broader than AI GPUs (includes ASICs, TPUs, other accelerators). The 80–90% figure is defensible for AI GPUs / data‑center accelerators, but overstated if interpreted as all AI chips.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Claim 3: “Major tech companies including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are all using NVIDIA GPUs for AI workloads”** – **VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Well-documented that Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS all offer Nvidia GPU instances (H100, A100, etc.) and use them internally for AI training. This is consistent across major news and cloud-provider documentation.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Claim 4: “The stock has risen over 200% in 2024”** – **CONTRADICTED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Summaries from Investopedia and Zacks note ~170–171% gain for Nvidia shares in 2024, after ~240% in 2023. “Over 200% in 2024” is materially inaccurate.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Source Assessment\n",
       "- **Overall source quality: 4/5**\n",
       "  - NVIDIA IR, Reuters, Bloomberg are high‑credibility; TechCrunch is decent for tech context.\n",
       "- **Concerns:**\n",
       "  - Despite naming good sources, the summary misstates numeric details (data center growth, 2024 stock performance), suggesting either outdated data or imprecise reading of those sources.\n",
       "  - Market-share wording is sloppy (“AI chip market” vs “AI GPUs”).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Answer Quality\n",
       "- **Does it answer the original question (“Why has NVIDIA stock performed so well recently?”)?** – **Partially**\n",
       "  - It lists some *facts correlated* with performance (explosive data center growth, dominance in AI GPUs, broad hyperscaler adoption, big stock move).\n",
       "- **Missing elements:**\n",
       "  - No explicit causal explanation (e.g., investor expectations for sustained AI demand, software ecosystem moat, margin expansion, limited competition, supply constraints/backlog).\n",
       "  - No discussion of valuation, risk factors, or whether performance is driven by earnings vs speculation.\n",
       "  - No time-frame clarity (“recently” vs 2023–2024 vs YTD 2025).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recommendations\n",
       "- Correct Claim 1 to the latest figure (≈90–100% YoY in the most recent quarter) and specify the quarter and source.\n",
       "- Rephrase Claim 2 as “~80–90% of the AI GPU / data-center GPU market” and cite that scope.\n",
       "- Fix Claim 4 to “about 170% in 2024” (or whatever precise figure is intended, sourced from a live price chart).\n",
       "- Add a short causal narrative: Nvidia’s stock outperformance is driven by:\n",
       "  - Massive revenue and earnings growth from AI data center chips,\n",
       "  - Near‑monopoly position in AI GPUs plus CUDA/software ecosystem lock‑in,\n",
       "  - Huge demand/backlog from hyperscalers (MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, etc.),\n",
       "  - Upward revisions in analyst estimates and sentiment.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Final Verdict\n",
       "- **Trustworthy and defensible?** – **With caveats**\n",
       "  - Directionally right on *why* Nvidia is strong in AI and widely adopted, but key numerical claims are inaccurate or outdated and the causal link to stock performance is underdeveloped. Needs correction and tightening before being relied on."

       "### Claim Verification\n",
       "- “Tesla will dominate the robotaxi market by 2025”: **UNVERIFIED (highly speculative)**\n",
       "  - Evidence: No commercial, large-scale Tesla robotaxi service is operating as of late 2024; regulatory approvals are limited and timelines repeatedly slip. “Dominate” and 2025 are forward-looking opinion, not fact.\n",
       "- “Full Self-Driving is already safer than human drivers”: **UNVERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Tesla cites internal miles-per-accident data, but independent regulators (e.g., NHTSA) have not certified FSD as safer than human drivers. Methodology, exposure, and selection bias are contested.\n",
       "- “Tesla's margins are industry-leading and sustainable”: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Historically true that Tesla had higher auto gross margins than many legacy OEMs, but 2023–24 reports show margin compression from price cuts and competition; “sustainable” is speculative.\n",
       "- “Competition from legacy automakers is irrelevant”: **CONTRADICTED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: VW, Ford, Hyundai/Kia, etc., are meaningfully present in EV markets; Tesla’s share has declined in some regions. Competition is clearly not “irrelevant.”\n",
       "\n",
       "- “Tesla's FSD claims are exaggerated and potentially dangerous”: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Multiple regulator investigations, crashes under review, and litigation suggest non-trivial safety concerns and debates over marketing claims. “Exaggerated/potentially dangerous” is evaluative but grounded in real investigations.\n",
       "- “Margins are declining due to price cuts and competition”: **VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Confirmed in recent Tesla earnings and major financial press: repeated price cuts and competition have pressured margins.\n",
       "- “Chinese EV makers are taking significant market share”: **VERIFIED (especially outside US)**\n",
       "  - Evidence: BYD and others have gained major share in China and are expanding abroad; they are intensifying competition, even if US penetration is limited by tariffs.\n",
       "- “Robotaxi timeline has been repeatedly delayed”: **VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Elon Musk has publicly shifted robotaxi/FSD timelines multiple times over years without full delivery of prior promises.\n",
       "\n",
       "- “Tesla maintains technology leadership but faces margin pressure”: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Widely accepted that Tesla is a tech leader in EV powertrain/software, while filings and earnings calls show margin compression.\n",
       "- “FSD progress is notable but regulatory approval timeline uncertain”: **VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Software advances and wider beta use are real, but no clear, binding timeline from regulators for full robotaxi deployment.\n",
       "- “Competition is intensifying but Tesla's brand remains strong”: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**\n",
       "  - Evidence: Increasing EV offerings globally; Tesla still has strong brand recognition and loyalty, though reputation is more polarizing than in earlier years.\n",

       "  - Hindenburg short-seller report: **3/5**\n",
       "  - Goldman Sachs equity research: **4/5**\n",
       "- Concerns:\n",
       "  - TeslaDaily: Strong bullish bias, promotional tone, heavy speculation on timelines and dominance.\n",
       "  - Hindenburg: Financial incentive to highlight worst-case scenarios; may overemphasize negatives and tail risks.\n",
       "  - Goldman Sachs: Bank research has conflicts (investment banking, trading interests) but uses structured models, disclosures, and is generally more balanced.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Answer Quality\n",
       "- Does it answer the original question (“12‑month outlook for Tesla stock”)? **Partially**\n",
       "- Missing elements:\n",
       "  - No explicit 12‑month risk/reward, scenario analysis, or valuation (P/E, FCF, relative to peers).\n",
       "  - No macro context (rates, EV subsidies, China policy, US tariffs).\n",
       "  - No distinction between long-term optionality (robotaxis) vs what will realistically move the stock in 12 months (deliveries, pricing, margins, regulation).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recommendations\n",
       "- Suggested corrections or additions:\n",
       "  - Treat robotaxi “dominance by 2025” and FSD safety superiority as speculative and unproven; clearly label them as opinion.\n",
       "  - Emphasize verified facts: margin compression, growing competition (especially China), continued tech and brand strengths.\n",
       "  - Use neutral primary data: Tesla financials, regulator actions, and multiple analyst reports, not just fan/short pieces.\n",
       "- Areas needing more research:\n",
       "  - Latest quarterly results (margins, volumes, capex, FSD revenue).\n",
       "  - Regulatory trajectory for autonomous driving in key markets.\n",
       "  - Comparative valuation vs other large-cap growth/auto/tech names.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Final Verdict\n",
       "- Trustworthy and defensible? **With caveats**\n",
       "  - On their own, the fan blog and short-seller report are too biased to rely on.  \n",
       "  - Goldman Sachs-style neutral research plus primary data provides the most credible base; the others are useful mainly to understand upside/downside narratives, not as factual guides."
