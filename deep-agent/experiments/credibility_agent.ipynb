    "# Credibility Sub-Agent Test Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tests the credibility sub-agent, which is responsible for:\n",
    "- **Claim Verification**: Checking if claims are supported by reliable evidence\n",
    "- **Source Assessment**: Evaluating the trustworthiness of sources used\n",
    "- **Consistency Checking**: Looking for contradictions or inconsistencies\n",
    "- **Bias Identification**: Noting potential biases in sources or analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The main agent uses this sub-agent to:\n",
    "- Verify research findings from the web research agent\n",
    "- Assess source quality and reliability\n",
    "- Identify potential misinformation or biased reporting\n",
    "- Rate overall trustworthiness of gathered information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook connects to the LangGraph server, which provides:\n",
    "- **Cloud-hosted store** - Persistent memory across sessions (same as LangSmith Studio)\n",
    "- **Cloud-hosted checkpointer** - Conversation state persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start the LangGraph server** (from the `deep-agent/` directory):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd deep-agent\n",
    "   langgraph dev\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wait for the server** to be ready at `http://localhost:2024`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run this notebook** - it connects to the same agent as LangSmith Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `langgraph dev`, LangGraph connects to LangSmith's cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Agent state persists across sessions\n",
    "- No local PostgreSQL database required\n",
    "- Assistant ID is auto-discovered so this notebook works for anyone\n"

       "### Claim Verification\n",
       "- **Claim**: “Apple Inc. is the most valuable publicly traded company in the world by market capitalization.”  \n",
       "  - **Status**: **CONTRADICTED** (as of late 2025)  \n",
       "  - **Evidence**:  \n",
       "    - Recent finance coverage (e.g., Yahoo Finance and summaries like Investopedia’s “Biggest Companies in the World by Market Cap” and “Trillion-dollar companies” list) indicates that **Nvidia (NVDA)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)** have recently traded at higher market capitalizations than Apple, with Nvidia notably reaching around **$4 trillion** in market value in 2025 and being described as the **most valuable company in the world**.  \n",
       "    - A Yahoo Finance headline explicitly: “Nvidia overtakes Microsoft as most valuable stock in the world … just two weeks after it took the No. 2 spot from Apple.” This implies Apple is **not currently #1** by market cap.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Source Assessment\n",
       "- **Overall source quality**: **4/5**  \n",

       "  - Exact day‑by‑day ranking can shift with stock price moves; news pieces usually describe status at or near publication date.  \n",
       "  - Rankings can change quickly among Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, so any “most valuable” statement needs a precise date reference.\n",

       "- **Does it answer the original question?** **Yes**  \n",
       "- **Missing elements**:  \n",
       "  - Exact current day ranking snapshot (precise market caps for Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft) isn’t listed numerically here, but directionally it’s clear Apple is not #1.\n",

       "### Claim Verification\n",
       "- **1. “NVIDIA's data center revenue grew over 200% year-over-year in their most recent quarter”**: VERIFIED  \n",
       "  - Evidence: Recent quarters (e.g., FY2024 Q3/Q4 and FY2025 Q1 by NVIDIA’s fiscal calendar) show data center revenue up roughly 300–400% YoY; “over 200%” is conservative relative to reported figures in earnings releases and coverage (Yahoo Finance/Forbes summaries of NVIDIA earnings).\n",
       "\n",
       "- **2. “The company has captured approximately 80-90% of the AI chip market”**: VERIFIED (as an estimate)  \n",
       "  - Evidence: Multiple finance/market pieces (e.g., Investopedia citing analysts, Yahoo/ Motley Fool–type analyses) reference NVIDIA having roughly 80–90% share of the AI accelerator/GPU market. This is an analyst estimate, not a precise audited figure, but it is widely cited and directionally accurate.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **3. “Major tech companies including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are all using NVIDIA GPUs for AI workloads”**: VERIFIED  \n",
       "  - Evidence: Public cloud offerings (Azure, Google Cloud, AWS) all advertise NVIDIA GPU instances for AI/ML; earnings calls and press releases from these firms repeatedly reference NVIDIA GPUs as core to AI infrastructure.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **4. “The stock has risen over 200% in 2024”**: PARTIALLY VERIFIED / TIME-SENSITIVE  \n",
       "  - Evidence: NVIDIA has had extremely large gains, but “over 200% in 2024” depends heavily on the exact start/end dates. At various points it has been up >200% over a 12‑month period, but the specific calendar‑year 2024 return might be lower depending on when you measure. This should be anchored to a date and return source (e.g., YTD return from Yahoo Finance as of a specific day).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Source Assessment\n",
       "- **Overall source quality: 4/5**  \n",
       "- **Concerns:**\n",
       "  - Listed sources (NVIDIA IR, Reuters, Bloomberg, TechCrunch) are generally high quality, but the summary doesn’t show which claim ties to which source.\n",
       "  - Market-share and performance figures are analyst/market estimates and should be labeled as such.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Answer Quality\n",
       "- **Does it answer the original question?** Partially  \n",
       "- **Missing elements:**\n",
       "  - Links between facts and “why the stock performed so well” are implied but not explicitly argued (e.g., explaining that explosive data center growth, dominant AI share, and adoption by major cloud providers drive revenue, margins, and expectations, which in turn drive the stock).\n",
       "  - No discussion of valuation, expectations, or broader AI investment narrative (rate environment, hype cycle, ETF flows, etc.).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recommendations\n",
       "- Add a short causal explanation: e.g., “NVIDIA’s dominant AI chip position and >200% YoY data center growth have led investors to expect sustained high revenue and profit growth, which has driven the stock price up.”\n",
       "- Quantify the stock performance more precisely: specify the date and the exact YTD or 12‑month return with a citation.\n",
       "- Clarify that 80–90% is an analyst estimate of AI accelerator/GPU share, not an official market statistic.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Final Verdict\n",
       "- **Trustworthy and defensible?** With caveats  \n",
       "  - The key factual claims are broadly accurate and supported by high-credibility sources, but the stock-return figure should be time-stamped, and the reasoning linking facts to the stock’s performance should be made more explicit."

       "- “Full Self-Driving is already safer than human drivers”: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED / CONTESTED**  \n",
       "  - Evidence: Tesla’s own safety reports and some third-party analyses claim fewer crashes per mile vs. average drivers, but these are not independently audited and NHTSA has opened multiple safety probes. Methodology and comparability are disputed.\n",
       "- “Tesla’s margins are industry-leading and sustainable”: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**  \n",
       "  - Evidence: Historically true that Tesla’s automotive gross margins were well above legacy OEMs, but finance sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance/Forbes) show gross margins fell from mid‑20s% in 2022 to high‑teens% or lower by 2024 due to price cuts. “Sustainable” is speculative.\n",
       "- “Competition from legacy automakers is irrelevant”: **CONTRADICTED**  \n",

       "- “Margins are declining due to price cuts and competition”: **VERIFIED**  \n",

       "- “Chinese EV makers are taking significant market share”: **VERIFIED (global), PARTIAL (U.S.)**  \n",

       "- “Robotaxi timeline has been repeatedly delayed”: **VERIFIED**  \n",
