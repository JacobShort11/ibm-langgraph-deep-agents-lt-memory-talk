    "# Web Research Sub-Agent Test Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tests the web research sub-agent, which is responsible for:\n",
    "- **Finding Information**: Searching for relevant, reliable sources\n",
    "- **Gathering Data**: Collecting facts, statistics, and quotes\n",
    "- **Documenting Sources**: Keeping detailed records of where information came from\n",
    "- **Assessing Initial Quality**: Noting if sources seem reliable or questionable\n",
    "\n",
    "The main agent uses this sub-agent to:\n",
    "- Research why stock prices are moving\n",
    "- Analyze recent price action, volume, and volatility\n",
    "- Investigate company-specific news, earnings, and guidance\n",
    "- Gather sector trends, competitor info, and macro factors\n",
    "- Collect datasets for the analysis agent to process\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook connects to the LangGraph server, which provides:\n",
    "- **Cloud-hosted store** - Persistent memory across sessions (same as LangSmith Studio)\n",
    "- **Cloud-hosted checkpointer** - Conversation state persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start the LangGraph server** (from the `deep-agent/` directory):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd deep-agent\n",
    "   langgraph dev\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wait for the server** to be ready at `http://localhost:2024`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run this notebook** - it connects to the same agent as LangSmith Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `langgraph dev`, LangGraph connects to LangSmith's cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Agent state persists across sessions\n",
    "- No local PostgreSQL database required\n",
    "- Same agent instance as LangSmith Studio"

       "- Nvidia and Broadcom are still highlighted by major brokers (e.g., Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Jefferies) as top AI plays heading into 2026, while AMD is seen as a beneficiary but with more uncertainty, and Intel faces more cautious views tied to its foundry challenges.

       "- Key cross‑currents: U.S.–China export controls on advanced AI chips (including potential reviews around Nvidia’s H200 and cloud “work‑arounds” for newer Blackwell chips), memory tightness/shortages, and power/capacity bottlenecks in data‑center build‑outs; all are central near‑term risk/catalyst narratives.

[Yahoo Finance – NVDA “Financial Analysis” snapshot](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/).  \n",
       "- Bernstein observed that Nvidia trades at about a 13% valuation discount vs. the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX), in the first percentile of the past decade, with only 13 days in 10 years when NVDA has been cheaper on this relative basis, which they argue “augurs well for future returns.” [Bloomberg summary cited by TS2.Tech](https://ts2.tech/en/semiconductor-stocks-news-dec-20-2025-microns-ai-memory-boom-nvidia-cheap-valuation-calls-and-the-2026-outlook/), [Bloomberg original](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-19/nvidia-discount-to-chip-index-at-historic-levels-bernstein-says).  \n",

       "- A sector recap notes that tightening memory pricing and AI‑driven HBM demand are pulling up the entire upstream supply chain, especially semiconductor equipment (etch, deposition, metrology) and advanced packaging, with Lam Research cited as hitting all‑time highs heading into 2026 on multiple target increases tied to memory strength.

       "- Jabil, a large manufacturing services company that assembles data‑center equipment among other things, reported a surge in quarterly profit and revenue that beat expectations, driven by AI‑related infrastructure demand, and raised its full‑year outlook while investing in AI/cloud infrastructure, which indirectly supports the view of robust AI hardware demand.

       "- I did not retrieve the official FOMC statement PDF or full press‑conference transcript from the Federal Reserve’s own site in the surfaced results, so specific sentence‑level quotes from the statement are based on media summaries rather than primary text.  \n",
       "- None of the accessible articles provided detailed, numerical sector‑by‑sector performance (e.g., banks vs REITs vs utilities) or explicit growth‑vs‑value index performance on the exact decision day; I relied instead on index‑level commentary and earlier reactions to rate‑cut expectations for style/sector implications.  \n",
       "- Concrete intraday or close‑to‑close moves in the US Dollar Index (DXY) and the 2‑year Treasury yield on Dec. 10, 2025 were not given in the surfaced sources; only qualitative or medium‑term observations on the dollar and bond yields were available.  \n",
       "- Market‑implied probabilities for future Fed meetings (e.g., fed funds futures curves with percentages) were not provided in the retrieved articles; forward‑looking commentary is therefore based on Fed projections and qualitative analyst views, not on explicit market‑implied odds."
