       "- AI-driven demand (especially data center GPUs, high‑bandwidth memory and AI infrastructure) remains the core secular growth driver for leading semiconductor names like Nvidia and Broadcom, and is a primary reason these are repeatedly cited as top picks by Wall Street. [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-broadcom-lead-bank-americas-161455468.html)  \n",
       "- The broader Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) has posted very strong gains over the past year, with one January 2024 snapshot showing it up about 50% year‑on‑year, reflecting broad enthusiasm around AI and a cyclical recovery in chips. [Yahoo Finance – Zacks article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-semiconductor-stocks-buy-sparkling-134400151.html)  \n",
       "- Recent individual stock performance is divergent: AMD has had periods of major outperformance but also suffered a notable slump; Broadcom recently fell more than 20% in under a month; Intel faces more cautious sentiment; Nvidia remains a primary AI beneficiary with strong analyst support. [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-problems-for-the-stock-price-of-nvidia-rival-amd-133029633.html) [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/12/18/broadcom-stock-has-fallen-20-what-next/) [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/12/17/should-you-be-cautious-about-intel-stock/)  \n",

       "- Geopolitics—especially U.S. export controls on advanced chips and tools to China—remain a key overhang but also reinforce Western on‑shoring and capex. China is actively pushing for domestic alternatives while U.S. policy periodically loosens/tightens what Nvidia and tool vendors can sell.

    "## Expected Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "For each example, the web research agent should provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Summary of Findings\n",
    "- Each statement with inline citation: [Source Name](URL)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Key Facts with Citations\n",
    "- Format: \"Fact statement [Source Name](URL)\"\n",
    "- No uncited claims\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Citations List\n",
    "- Numbered list of all sources used\n",
    "- Brief description of what info came from each source\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Gaps in Research\n",
    "- What couldn't be found or verified\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Output\n",
    "\n",
    "When the agent finds useful data, it should save to:\n",
    "- `scratchpad/data/` - CSV files, datasets for analysis\n",
    "- `scratchpad/notes/` - Detailed research notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices Being Tested\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple search queries to triangulate information\n",
    "- Noting the date of sources (recency matters)\n",
    "- Distinguishing between news, opinion, and research\n",
    "- Flagging unreliable sources\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integration with Main Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, the main agent would:\n",
    "1. Assign research tasks to `web-research-agent`\n",
    "2. Receive findings with citations\n",
    "3. Send findings to `credibility-agent` for verification\n",
    "4. Pass verified data to `analysis-agent` for processing\n",
    "5. Compile everything into final reports"
