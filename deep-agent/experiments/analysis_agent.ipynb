      "- Realized volatility (30‑min return standard deviation) spikes notably in **equities** and **Gold** after 14:00; bond yield changes also show an increase in volatility, especially at the long end (UST_10Y, UST_30Y).\n",

      "- Cumulative moves are treated as **additive** across 30‑min intervals; this is a good approximation for small % moves but not identical to compounding.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like, I can also:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Split the event into narrower windows (e.g., 14:00–14:30 vs 14:30–15:00) and attribute P&L by sub-window, or  \n",
