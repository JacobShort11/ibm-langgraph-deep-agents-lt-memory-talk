       "1. Key findings\n",
       "\n",
       "- Portfolio-level impact (14:00–14:30 window):\n",
       "  - Approximate total event impact on the portfolio: **+0.86%** (driven almost entirely by equities and gold; bond and oil moves were a small drag/offset in this simplified % framework).\n",
       "- Most significant price reaction (level move):\n",
       "  - By event-window move (sum of 14:00→14:30 changes): **QQQ** had the largest positive move, followed closely by **SPY**, **IWM**, and **Gold**.\n",
       "  - In absolute terms, the **largest single 30‑min bar** across all assets is the **14:00–14:30 spike in QQQ** (≈ +1.8–2.1%).\n",
       "- Volatility spike:\n",
       "  - Pre window (13:30–14:00) had very muted changes across all assets.\n",
       "  - Post window (14:00–14:30) shows a sharp jump in realized volatility for **SPY, QQQ, IWM, Gold, Oil, Dollar Index, and the Treasury tenors**.\n",
       "  - For several assets the pre window has only one observation, so the volatility spike is visible in the post window but not statistically testable in a strict sense.\n",
       "- Statistically “most significant” (t-stat proxy):\n",
       "  - Using a simple pre vs post absolute-move t-test, the only assets with a non‑NaN t‑stat are those with >1 pre and post observations; in this dataset that’s effectively limited and the t-stats are not reliable given the tiny sample.\n",
       "  - Within that limitation, **equity indices (especially QQQ)** and **Gold** show the strongest jump in absolute moves post‑announcement.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Multi-panel visualization (with 14:00 vertical line)\n",
