    "# Analysis Sub-Agent Test Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tests the analysis sub-agent, which is responsible for:\n",
    "- Data analysis and processing\n",
    "- Creating visualizations (saved to URLs)\n",
    "- Statistical analysis and trend identification\n",
    "- Supporting the main agent's Markets Research & Portfolio Risk Orchestration goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The main agent uses this sub-agent to:\n",
    "- Analyze equity and factor data\n",
    "- Generate price reaction analysis\n",
    "- Create correlation, beta, and sector aggregation visualizations\n",
    "- Execute any task requiring code execution, charts, or numerical summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook connects to the LangGraph server, which provides:\n",
    "- **Cloud-hosted store** - Persistent memory across sessions (same as LangSmith Studio)\n",
    "- **Cloud-hosted checkpointer** - Conversation state persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start the LangGraph server** (from the `deep-agent/` directory):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd deep-agent\n",
    "   langgraph dev\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wait for the server** to be ready at `http://localhost:2024`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run this notebook** - it connects to the same agent as LangSmith Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `langgraph dev`, LangGraph connects to LangSmith's cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Agent state persists across sessions\n",
    "- No local PostgreSQL database required\n",
    "- Same agent instance as LangSmith Studio"
